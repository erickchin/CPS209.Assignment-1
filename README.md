This assignment is a wrap up of the core concepts of object orientated design and coded with Java.
The concept of this game is to match your own object onto the objects randomly placed onto the Jframe. Patterns are randomly generated and timed to have its pattern disappear. It incorporates inheritance, basic GUI and event handling to interact with the user's input.
